# ShortestPath-GeneticAlgorithm-Csharp

This is a windows form application as implementation of Shortest Path problem using genetic algorithm along with visualization. This application uses adjacency matrix or Coordinates are generated randomly based on the number of nodes specified in code. This algorithm finds the optimal path from source to destination node in least number of hops. For the child Population, this application uses both crossover and mutation.
